==================
   Dynare Fixer
==================

This allows you to add functions within Dynare. Before your model section you can declare any functions
you might want to use in your code.

For example, here is a Cobb-Douglas production function:

  def f(l, k)  = l^alpha * k^beta;

The derivatives you still need to do manually:

  def f1(l, k) = alpha * l^(alpha - 1) * k^beta;
  def f2(l, k) = beta * l^alpha * k^(beta - 1);

Then somewhere in your model section you might have an Euler equation something like this (where u2 is a
partial derivative of a utility function):

  u2(c, l) = beta * u2(c(+1), l(+1));

==================
   Dependencies
==================

To use Dynare Fixer, you have to have the Ruby programming language installed. In Ubuntu this can be done
easily:

  sudo apt-get install ruby

Then to run you use it like this:

  ruby dynare_fixer.rb INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

Where INPUT_FILE is the .mod file with the function declarations, and OUTPUT_FILE is where the outputted
valid Dynare code will go.
